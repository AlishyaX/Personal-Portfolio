    {
        "name": "Battle Simulator",
        "description": "This project allows users to create, manage, and battle RPG characters.",
        "process": "I found the programming process very difficult at first as we incorporated data visualization, statistical analysis, and random data generation using Python libraries.",
        "lessons": "Through this project I learned more about libraries and how to use them.\nI also learned more about using inner and helper functions to make code organized efficiently.",
        "role": "This was a personal project."
    },
    {
        "name": "Coin Change Problem",
        "description": "This project allows users to solve the Coin Change Problem by inputting a target amount and the available coin denominations.\nThe program loads the coin denominations from a file based on the user's input of a country and then calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make the target amount.\nThe program also displays the names of the coins used in the solution.",
        "process": "I found the programming process only difficult with figuring out how to make the code be able to read and take the information properly with the format needed for the csv file.",
        "lessons": "I learned many different approaches to split the information in a csv file and get the information needed and not less or more than that.",
        "role": "This was a personal project."
    },
    {
        "name": "Financial Calculator",
        "description": "This project completes the following basic financial calculations: savings goal, compound interest calculator, budget allocater, sale price calculator, and tip calculator.",
        "process": "I found the programming process only difficult with figuring out the calculations for the compound interest calculator ",
        "lessons": "I learned more about how financial calculator's work and the backround for how why they do what they do.",
        "role": "This was a personal project."
    },
    {
        "name": "High Score Tracker",
        "description": "This project will track the high score for a rock paper scissors game with the computer and display the top 10 scores from everyone who plays the game.",
        "process": "I found the programming process fairly easy as my job was only to work on the main user interface with the options and it having multiple user profiles.",
        "lessons": "I learned an efficient way to handle multiple user profiles by saving them to a csv file that saves their profile forever.",
        "role": "I was the UX/UI Designer."
    },
    {
        "name": "Random Password Generator",
        "description": "This project allows a user to specify password requirements (length, upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters) and then gives them 4 possible passwords they could use. ",
        "process": "I found the programming process fairly simple but I had to search up better ways than what I thought to do because my old way would have been very repetitive and uneccesary.",
        "lessons": "I learned how to use ASCII letters and why it is used.",
        "role": "This was a personal project."
    },
    {
        "name": "Simple Morse Code Translator",
        "description": "This project translates between English and Morse Code.",
        "process": "I found the programming process actually very complex, not because of the amount of code because it only needed very little code but because of the logic needed to understand why something is coded the way it is.",
        "lessons": "I learned how morse code is written and typed and just the simple switching english to morse code vice versa.",
        "role": "This was a personal project."
