# Coin Change Problem

## Project Description
---
The purpose of this project is to make a program that allows users to solve the Coin Change Problem by inputting a target amount and the available coin denominations. The program should load the coin denominations from a file based on the user's input of a country and then calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make the target amount. The program should also display the names of the coins used in the solution. 

## Execution and Usage
---
To use this project what you have to do is run the program and then it will ask you if you would want to type in your coin change amount or exit. If you type 1 (type in the coin change amount) then it will ask the country and then show the types of coin currency from there. You then have to type in your target amount and then it will tell you how many coins and which coins are needed to get to that target amount. If you type in 2(Exit) then it exits out of the program.

## Curent Features

+ I am proud of my code being able to do the right calcultions to figure out the exact amount of coins needed
+ I am also proud of all of the Error handling things that are in the code that inform the user of what they did and takes them back to try again 
+ Lastly I am proud of how the code read the csv file as it took many trials and errors to get it to work properly
